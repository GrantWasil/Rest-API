# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - REST API Project

A REST API platform built using the [Express](https://expressjs.com) framework for use with teacher and course tracking for a school. Teachers can be generated and assigned to courses. Courses can be manipulated and deleted, but only by an authenticated user. 

See my other work at my [Website](http://www.grantwasil.com)

## Motivation
This is the framework for my next project where I will build out the front-end side for this application. This was also project nine of the TeamTreehouse Fullstack Javascript tech-degree. 

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Sequelize]](https://sequelize.org)
- [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

## Contribute 
Since I am a newer developer, I am open to feedback regarding my application. Please feel free to open a ticket or to contact me directly.
